## Welcome to my new blog
This static blog type website is going to be a way to share my coding content to the world.  
I'll mainly be talking about Anarchy engine here, maybe a little bit of saplusplus if I get around to continuing it.

I'll write some OpenGL tutorials aswell with true noobs in mind,  
Maybe some networking tutorials as I advance personally.
