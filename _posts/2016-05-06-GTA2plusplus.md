## New project, GTA2++!
This is a "hack" for GTA2, intended to provide more advanced features to GTA2's singleplayer.
For those interested in my Reverse Engineering notes, find them here: -placehold-

I'll update when theres more of a final goal, other than reverse engineer GTA2.
This projected is coded in C++ and maybe uploaded to a GitHub repo. :)

Hopefully I'll have a game to release here soon to...
